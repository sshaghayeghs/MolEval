Drawing on the precedents set by `SentEval`—a toolkit designed to assess sentence embeddings— and `MoleculeNet`, a benchmark suite for molecular machine learning, we introduce MolEval. MolEval innovatively tackles the issue of evaluating large language models `(LLMs)` embeddings, which are traditionally expensive to execute on standard computing hardware. It achieves this by offering a repository of pre-computed `molecule embeddings`, alongside a versatile platform that facilitates the evaluation of any embeddings derived from molecular structures. This approach not only streamlines the assessment process but also makes it more accessible to researchers and practitioners in the field.
